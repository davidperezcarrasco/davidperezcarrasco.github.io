Our paper titled *Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Urban Water Networks Using a Hierarchical Deep Learning Model*  has been accepted for publication at the prestigious *International Congress of Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2024*. I am honored to be presenting this research at the congress, which will take place in Miami in December 2024.
