Our paper titled ["Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Urban Water Networks Using a Hierarchical Deep Learning Model"](https://github.com/davidperezcarrasco/Anomaly-Detection-Hierarchical-Deep-Learning-Model/blob/main/paper.pdf)  has been accepted for publication at the prestigious *[International Congress of Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2024](https://www.icmla-conference.org/icmla24/)*. I am honored to be presenting this research at the congress, which will take place in Miami in December 2024.
