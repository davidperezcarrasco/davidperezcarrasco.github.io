Our paper titled *Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Urban Water Networks Using a Hierarchical Deep Learning Model*, originally developed for the [AB Data Challenge (Aig√ºes de Barcelona)](https://www.abdatachallenge.cat/en/home-en/), has been accepted for publication at the prestigious *International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA) 2024*. I am honored to be presenting this research at the congress, which will take place in Miami in December 2024.
