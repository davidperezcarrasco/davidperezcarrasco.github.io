My Bachelor's Thesis, ["Efficient Algorithms for Linearly Solvable Markov Decision Processes"](https://davidperezcarrasco.github.io/projects/1_project/) was successfully defended and received a score of 9,8. This achievement marks the completion of my studies in mathematical Engineering in Data Science, culminating in a final grade of 8,72/10. Looking forward to the next steps in the professional career with great excitement.
