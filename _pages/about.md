I am a passionate and driven ML/AI researcher with a year of experience in the field of reinforcement learning. As an intern at the [ML/AI research group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), I have contributed to the development and evaluation of novel algorithms such as Q Learning and Z Learning, applying them to challenging Minigrid environments using Markov Decision Problems and Linearly-solvable Markov Decision Problems.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
