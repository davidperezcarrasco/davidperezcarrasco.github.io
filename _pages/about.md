I am a passionate and driven ML/AI researcher with a year of experience in the field of reinforcement learning. As an intern at the [ML/AI research group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), I have contributed to the development and evaluation of novel algorithms such as Q Learning and Z Learning, applying them to challenging Minigrid environments using Markov Decision Problems and Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Problems.

Currently, I am working on my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of [Anders Jonsson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson), head of the research group. My thesis focuses on improving the performance and scalability of these algorithms in larger and more complex domains. This research involves finding efficient computational methods for optimal action selection and optimizing value function approximation within linear LMDPs.
