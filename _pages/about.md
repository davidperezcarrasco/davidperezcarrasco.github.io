Member of the AI & ML Research Group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. Exchange student at University of British Columbia

I am a passionate and driven ML/AI researcher with a year of experience in the field of reinforcement learning. As an intern at the [ML/AI research group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/ai-ml), I have contributed to the development and evaluation of novel algorithms such as Q Learning and Z Learning, applying them to challenging Minigrid environments using Markov Decision Problems and Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Problems.

Currently, I am working on my undergraduate thesis under the guidance of [Anders Jonsson](https://www.upf.edu/web/anders-jonsson), head of the research group. My thesis focuses on improving the performance and scalability of these algorithms in larger and more complex domains. This research involves finding efficient computational methods for optimal action selection and optimizing value function approximation within linear LMDPs.

My interest in ML/AI was sparked during my exchange at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), where I took courses on Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, and Statistics. I was fascinated by the potential and the challenges of this field, and I decided to pursue it further. Furthermore, my dedication to research is demonstrated by my accelerated academic progress. By completing all coursework six months ahead of schedule, I secured the opportunity to fully dedicate myself to research and remain readily available for exciting new opportunities in the ever-evolving realm of AI and ML.
